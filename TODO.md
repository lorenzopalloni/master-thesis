--------------------------------------------------

## high priority

- [bureaucracy] ask administration about taxes
- [code] add VMAF as quality metric for video
- [code] train with PNG for ground-truth images
- [code] train again replacing LPIPS with another perceptual loss
- [optimizations] draft custom dataloader section

---

## medium priority
- [metrics] put some details on some metrics, especially where you have already written something
- [metrics] add VMAF description, once you have used it

---

## low priority
- [background] add citations
- [background] update content with a recent survey on video reconstruction
- find a quote

---

### Comments

Thesis title:
- Tecniche di ottimizzazione di reti neurali per il miglioramento della qualit√† visuale
- Optimization techniques of deep learning models for visual quality improvement
