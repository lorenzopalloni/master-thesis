# TODO List

- propose changes in the title:
    - Tecniche di ottimizzazione di reti neurali per la super risoluzione
    - Optimization techniques of deep learning models for super-resolution

- propose changes in the structure:
    1. Introduction
    2. Background
    3. Metrics
    4. Architectures
        - SRUNet
    5. Optimizations
        - Overview optimization techniques for Deep Learning-based SR models
        - Custom dataloader to speed up training
        - TensorRT to speed up inference
    6. Experiments
    7. Conclusions

## high priority
- add VMAF as quality metric for video
- train with PNG for ground-truth images
- train again replacing LPIPS with another perceptual loss

- metrics: clean up
- architectures: draft SRUNet explanation
- optimizations: draft overview optimization techniques
- optimizations: draft custom dataloader section
- optimizations: draft tensorrt section
- experiments: clean up

- bureaucracy about thesis:
    - website
    - a CS professor: ask about supervisor and especially about Leonardo Galtieri
        that should not be able to do as supervisor cause he's an adjunct professor
    - mighelett'
    - emilio

---

## medium priority
- replace LPIPS with one of the new metrics available in the literature as loss
- explain DISTS
- explain ERQAv2.0

---

## low priority
- background: add citations
- background: update content with a recent survey on video reconstruction
- find a quote
