# TODO List

## high priority

Thesis title:
- Optimization techniques of deep learning models for visual quality improvement
- Tecniche di ottimizzazione di reti neurali per il miglioramento della qualit√† visuale

Structure:
- Intro
- 1. Literature review about video restoration
    - RSGAN
    - ERSGAN
- 2. IQA/VQA metrics
- 3. SRUNet
    - description UNet / SRUNet
    - code optimization with custom dataloader with buffer to deal with GPU bottleneck
    - TensorRT
- 4. Experiments and Results
- Conclusion

- IMPORTANT: add VMAF as quality metric for video

- ask info to the CS department (and also to Mighelett') about bureaucracy around the master's thesis at UniFI
- I think that you need at least two supervisors, one will be Marco,
    but the other one we don't know if he can be Leonardo, since he's an
    adjunct professor, and maybe he can only be a co-supervisor, 
    so I should ask someone at the CS department to be sure,
    and in case to look for the other supervisor.

## medium priority
- replace LPIPS with one of the new metrics available in the literature as loss
- explain DISTS
- explain ERQAv2.0
