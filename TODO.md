# TODO List

## high priority
- propose a change in the title:
    - Tecniche di ottimizzazione di reti neurali per la super risoluzione
    - Optimization techniques of deep learning models for super-resolution

- add VMAF as quality metric for video
- bureaucracy about thesis:
    - website
    - a CS professor: ask about supervisor and especially about Leonardo Galtieri
        that should not be able to do as supervisor cause he's an adjunct professor
    - mighelett'
    - emilio

---

## medium priority
- replace LPIPS with one of the new metrics available in the literature as loss
- explain DISTS
- explain ERQAv2.0

---

## low priority
- find a quote

---
