Video restoration is a widely studied task in the field of computer vision and image processing. The primary objective of video restoration is to improve the visual quality of degraded videos caused by various factors such as noise, blur, compression artefacts, and other distortions. In recent years, deep learning techniques have gained significant attention in the field of video restoration due to their superior performance compared to traditional methods.

Traditional video restoration techniques involve the use of mathematical algorithms to reduce distortions \cite{fan2019brief}. Some of the commonly used techniques include median filtering, bilateral filtering, and wavelet-based denoising. While these methods are effective in restoring some aspects of the video quality, they have limited performance in handling complex distortions and restoring high-frequency details.

Deep learning-based video restoration methods have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in restoring degraded videos. By leveraging deep neural networks to learn the underlying mapping between the degraded and the ground truth images, these methods allow for the restoration of high-frequency details and complex distortions in videos.

Super-resolution (SR), the process of increasing the spatial resolution of an image or video, is a critical task in video restoration. Deep learning-based super-resolution techniques typically use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the underlying mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images.

The most commonly used approaches are single-image super-resolution (SISR) and multiple-image super-resolution (MISR). In SISR, a CNN is trained to generate a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image by minimizing a loss function that measures the difference between a generated image and its ground-truth counterpart. In MISR, a CNN is trained to generate a high-resolution image from multiple low-resolution images. 

Deep learning models for video restoration, including super-resolution and artefact removal, have made significant progress in recent years. However, the computational complexity of these models remains a major hurdle for their deployment in real-world applications. One promising strategy for reducing the computational demands of deep learning models is the use of quantization techniques. Quantization involves representing the weights and activations of a model with fewer bits, aiming to minimize the loss of accuracy. This approach can lead to substantial improvements in inference speed and memory usage, making it especially attractive for implementing video restoration models on resource-constrained devices.

This thesis focuses on examining the efficacy of quantization techniques for enhancing the inference speed and reducing the memory usage of deep learning models applied to video restoration tasks, including artefact removal and SR. The research encompasses an extensive review of the literature on quantization techniques for deep learning models and their application in the field of video restoration. In particular, the thesis investigates the implementation and evaluation of post-training quantization using TensorRT \cite{tensorrt}, an NVIDIA SDK designed for high-performance deep learning inference.

The findings of this thesis are expected to contribute to the knowledge and development of more practical and efficient video restoration models. These models could potentially be deployed in a variety of real-world applications, such as mobile devices, embedded systems, and IoT devices.
