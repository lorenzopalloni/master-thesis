2.1 Introduction

Video restoration is an essential task in the field of computer vision and image processing. The primary objective of video restoration is to improve the visual quality of degraded videos caused by various factors such as noise, blur, compression artifacts, and other distortions. In recent years, deep learning techniques have gained significant attention in the field of video restoration due to their superior performance compared to traditional methods. In this chapter, we will review the existing literature on video restoration, focusing on the optimization techniques of deep learning models for visual quality improvement.

2.2 Traditional Video Restoration Techniques

Traditional video restoration techniques involve the use of mathematical algorithms to reduce the effects of noise, blur, and other distortions. Some of the commonly used techniques include median filtering, bilateral filtering, and wavelet-based denoising. While these methods are effective in restoring some aspects of the video quality, they have limited performance in handling complex distortions and restoring high-frequency details.

2.3 Deep Learning-based Video Restoration

Deep learning-based video restoration methods have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in restoring degraded videos. These methods use deep neural networks to learn the underlying mapping between the degraded and the ground-truth images. The use of deep learning techniques allows for the restoration of high-frequency details and the removal of complex distortions in videos.

2.4 Optimization Techniques for Deep Learning-based Video Restoration

Optimizing deep learning models is essential for achieving high-quality video restoration results. In this section, we will review the existing optimization techniques used in deep learning-based video restoration.

2.4.1 Loss Functions

The choice of loss function is critical in training deep learning models for video restoration. The loss function measures the difference between the restored video and the ground-truth video. Commonly used loss functions include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), perceptual loss, and adversarial loss. Perceptual loss and adversarial loss are often used in conjunction with MSE or MAE to improve the visual quality of the restored video.

2.4.2 Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is an essential technique used in deep learning-based video restoration to increase the diversity of the training data. The use of data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation helps to prevent overfitting and improves the generalization performance of the deep learning model.

2.4.3 Regularization

Regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout are used to prevent overfitting of the deep learning model. Weight decay adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from learning high weights, while dropout randomly drops out some neurons during training to improve the generalization performance of the model.

2.4.4 Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a technique used to transfer knowledge from a pre-trained model to a new model. In video restoration, transfer learning is often used to initialize the deep learning model with pre-trained weights from a model trained on a similar task or dataset. Transfer learning helps to improve the convergence speed and generalization performance of the model.

2.4.5 Model Architecture

The choice of model architecture is critical in achieving high-quality video restoration results. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for video restoration due to their ability to learn spatial and temporal features. The architecture of the CNN can be modified by changing the number of layers, kernel size, and activation function to improve the performance of the model.

2.5 Conclusion

In this chapter, we have reviewed the existing literature on video restoration, focusing on the optimization techniques of deep learning models for visual quality improvement. We have discussed the limitations of traditional video restoration techniques and the advantages of deep learning-based methods. We have also reviewed the different optimization techniques used in deep learning-based video

Chapter 2: Literature Review

2.1 Introduction

Video restoration is an important task in computer vision and image processing that aims to improve the visual quality of degraded videos. One of the most promising approaches for video restoration is the use of deep learning techniques. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in video restoration tasks such as denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. In this chapter, we will review the literature on video restoration, with a focus on deep learning-based techniques and optimization techniques for improving visual quality.

2.2 Traditional Video Restoration Techniques

Traditional video restoration techniques typically involve mathematical algorithms such as filtering, wavelet-based denoising, and deconvolution. Although these methods are effective in restoring some aspects of video quality, they have limited performance in handling complex distortions and restoring high-frequency details.

2.3 Deep Learning-based Video Restoration Techniques

Deep learning-based video restoration methods use neural networks to learn the underlying mapping between degraded and ground-truth images. These methods have shown superior performance compared to traditional techniques in restoring complex distortions and high-frequency details. Some of the commonly used deep learning-based video restoration techniques include denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution.

2.4 Super-Resolution Techniques

Super-resolution is the process of increasing the spatial resolution of an image or video. It is a critical task in video restoration as it helps to improve the visual quality of videos. Super-resolution can be achieved using both traditional and deep learning-based techniques. However, deep learning-based techniques have shown superior performance in recent years.

2.4.1 Deep Learning-based Super-Resolution Techniques

Deep learning-based super-resolution techniques typically use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the underlying mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images. The most commonly used deep learning-based super-resolution techniques are single-image super-resolution (SISR) and multiple-image super-resolution (MISR).

In SISR, a CNN is trained to generate a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image. The CNN learns the underlying mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images by minimizing a loss function that measures the difference between the generated high-resolution image and the ground-truth high-resolution image.

In MISR, a CNN is trained to generate a high-resolution image from multiple low-resolution images. The CNN learns the underlying mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images by using multiple input images to improve the accuracy of the generated high-resolution image.

2.4.2 State-of-the-Art Super-Resolution Techniques

One of the state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques is the Residual Dense Network (RDN). RDN is a deep learning-based super-resolution technique that uses residual dense blocks (RDBs) to learn the underlying mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images. RDN has shown superior performance compared to other super-resolution techniques in terms of both quantitative and qualitative measures.

Another state-of-the-art super-resolution technique is the Recursive Spatially Variant Deconvolutional Network (RSVDecon). RSVDecon is a deep learning-based super-resolution technique that uses a recursive spatially variant deconvolutional network to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images. RSVDecon has shown superior performance in restoring high-frequency details in videos.

The RSGAN model is another state-of-the-art super-resolution technique that combines generative adversarial networks (GANs) with residual learning. The RSGAN model uses a generator network to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution images and a discriminator network to distinguish between the generated high-resolution images and the ground-truth high-resolution images. RSGAN has shown superior performance in restoring high-frequency details and natural textures in videos.

2.5 Optimization Techniques for Deep Learning-based Video Restoration

Optimizing deep learning models is critical to improving their performance in video restoration tasks. Several optimization techniques have been proposed to improve the performance of deep learning-based video restoration models.

2.5.1 Loss Function Optimization

Loss function optimization is a common technique used to improve the performance of deep learning-based video restoration models. The loss function measures the difference between the generated output and the ground-truth output, and the optimization process aims to minimize this difference. Different loss functions can be used for different video restoration tasks, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and perceptual loss.

Perceptual loss is a commonly used loss function in video restoration tasks. Perceptual loss measures the difference between the high-level features of the generated output and the ground-truth output, instead of pixel-wise differences. By using perceptual loss, deep learning models can capture high-level features, such as texture and structure, and generate more visually appealing results.

2.5.2 Network Architecture Optimization

Network architecture optimization is another technique used to improve the performance of deep learning-based video restoration models. The network architecture determines the complexity of the model and its ability to capture complex patterns in the input data. Different architectures, such as U-Net, ResNet, and DenseNet, have been proposed for different video restoration tasks.

2.5.3 Regularization Techniques

Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of deep learning-based video restoration models. Regularization techniques include dropout, weight decay, and data augmentation. Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Weight decay is a technique that penalizes large weights to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation is a technique that artificially increases the size of the training dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, cropping, and flipping.

2.5.4 Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a technique used to transfer knowledge learned from one task to another task. Transfer learning has been used to improve the performance of deep learning-based video restoration models by initializing the model with pre-trained weights from a related task. For example, a deep learning-based super-resolution model can be initialized with pre-trained weights from a deep learning-based image classification model.

2.6 Conclusion

We also reviewed the state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques, including the RSGAN model, and optimization techniques such as loss function optimization, network architecture optimization, regularization techniques, and transfer learning.
